### Thesis
It is easy to be discouraged about environmental pollution, but
harmful pollutants like pm2.5 have been steadily decreasing in cities like LA for the past 25 years!

### Context for Data Visualization
My data visualization clearly shows that with every 5 year gap since 1999, monthly pm2.5 levels in LA have decreased.
When I was reading the article about the harmful chemical pm2.5, it made me highly concerned and worried by the list of 
health risks it causes- including death. Even though it is still present in LA's air, legislation and regulations have clearly
cut down the amount drastically within the past few decades. 

### Data I Will be Visualizing
From EPA, I used 6 files. Each file measures daily pm2.5 levels in the LA region over the course of a year. 
My code finds the monthly averages of these years, and a user can compare these averages by selecting years to display.

### Specific Stategies from SwD to Help me
Although the graph can look busy if the user chooses to display every option, my dash loads with only 1999 and 
2000 displayed, so the user can clearly see the improvement. The user can then compare any two (or more) years they want and 
see that levels have been decreasing. In this way, I am making it easy for the audience to see the differences.

Simplified axes and titles lessen cognitive load and makes the main idea clearer to the audience.

There is lots of white, open space on my dash, which also lessens clutter and cognitive load for the audience.
